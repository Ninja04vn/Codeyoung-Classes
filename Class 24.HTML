<h1><center>Class 24-Debugging tips</center></h1>

<p>
● Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually 
 cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown above. These 
are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's 
 syntax and know what the error messages mean.
● Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, 
but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the 
 program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax 
 errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of 
 the error.
Now how to solve these issues we should debug our code:
1. Check all your syntax.
 2. Check whether all the tags are opened or closed properly or not, when
 we use VS Code or Sublime its color combination scheme helps us tofind errors
  3. Check the CSS is applied to correct tag
  4. Check that the CSS is not taken over by any other CSS properties
  5. If no CSS is coming check whether file is linked or not.
  6. Use Inspect Mode of browser to check all the code using Ctrl+Shift+I   or right mouse click then select inspect
  7. Check sources section to look which files are linked with that HTML 
 file.
 8. Tell the student that for debugging we use the console window in 
 inspect mode.</p>
