<!-- Javascript Objects:
A javascript object is an entity having state and behaviour 
(properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass,
keyboard, monitor etc.
JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in 
JavaScript.
JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't 
create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.-->
